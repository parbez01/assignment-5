# assignment-5.Summer sale description

Here as the first section I have a banner with a promo code inside the banner and an image on the other side.Next section links to some of my products with prices.Then on the other side we have a button to apply the promo code and a button to calculate the total price.
And in normal condition we can't use promo code when our selected products total price will go above 200 taka only then we can use promo code and discount pump.
